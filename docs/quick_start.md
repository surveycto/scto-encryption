# Quick start guide

This quick start guide is aimed at helping basic users access the core functions of the scto-encryption package as quickly as possible. You'll be able to generate encryption keys, encrypt CSV data, and decrypt it by following these steps. Advanced users can refer to the main documentation.

## Prerequisites

This quick start guide has some prerequisites and assumptions:

1. You need to know what the Command Prompt (or "Terminal") application on your computer is and how to type and run basic commands. If you have never used the terminal or run any computer code ever, you might need to look for additional resources to help you.
2. Python must be installed on your computer. You can download a user-friendly installer from [the Python website](https://www.python.org/). Confirm that Python is installed by running `python3 --version` or `python --version` in the terminal. It should report the installed version number. Make sure you are using at least Python 3.8 (but a later version will also work well).
3. You must install the scto-encryption package by running `pip install git+https://github.com/surveycto/scto-encryption.git`. You can confirm that it is installed by running `pip list | findstr scto-encryption` on Windows or `pip list | grep scto-encryption` on MacOS or Linux. It will list the package name, followed by the latest version number (`1.0.0`).

**Important**: If `python3 --version` works but `python --version` does not, use `python3` and `pip3` in all commands instead of `python` and `pip`. Make sure you are running at least Python 3.8!

Optional: You can run the script in a [virtual environment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9Vm9Uxk5pA), if you prefer.

## How to run a Python command

### Run commands

To start Python, open the Command Prompt (or "Terminal" on MacOS or Linux), and run the `python` command. You can then enter and run Python commands. For example, you can run this command:

    from scto_encryption.functions import generateKey

Followed by this command:

    generateKey('C:\\Users\\surveycto.user\\Documents\\Keys\\my_key.pem')

We will discuss these commands [later](#generating-an-encryption-key).

### Run a Python file

To run a Python file, type `python` in the terminal, followed by the file path in quotes. Here is an example:

    python "C:\\Users\\surveycto.user\\Documents\\Python scripts\\quick_key.py"

All of the top-level files in [this folder](../source/) can be run this way once they are downloaded to your computer.

## Generating an encryption key

The `scto-encryption` package generates encryption keys similar to the SurveyCTO platform's which enable [form data encryption](https://docs.surveycto.com/02-designing-forms/02-additional-topics/06.encrypting.html) but with an important difference: only one key file is is used for both encryption and decryption. That key needs to be safeguarded.

To generate your key, first customize the file path in the [`quick_key.py`](../source/quick_key.py) template file. Specify the path where you would like the key to be created, including the file name. Your file named should end in ".pem". Here are the contents of `quick_key.py`:

```
from scto_encryption.functions import generateKey
generateKey('C:\\Users\\surveycto.user\\Documents\\Keys\\my_key.pem')
```

Once you have customized the file, you can run it using the terminal application on your computer. When it is complete, check the specified folder, and make sure the key has been created.

**Important notes**:

* Ensure the folder path already exists. In the above example, make sure the `C:\\Users\\surveycto.user\\Documents\\Keys\\` folder already exists.
* The example path above is for Windows. On MacOS and Linux, use a single forward slash `/` instead of a double-backslash `\\` (Windows uses backslashes in folder paths, but backslashes are also used by Python, so the double-backslash means to use an actual backslash). Here is an example file path in Windows:<br>
`C:\\Users\\surveycto.user\\Documents\\my_key.pem`<br>
And here is an example file path in MacOS or Linux:<br>
`/Users/surveycto.user/Documents/my_key.pem`<br>
Consult your operating system's operating manual as required.
* When specifying the path, for consistent results, use the absolute path (i.e. the path from the root of your system, e.g. `C:\\` on Windows), as opposed to the relative path (the path relative to the Python file).
* Keep this file secure, since it will be used to both encrypt and decrypt your data. We recommend you don't back it up to the cloud (such as Dropbox, OneDrive, or Google Drive) unless it is in a highly secure environment, such as a secure note in a password manager.

## Encrypting a CSV file

Prepare a CSV file and note the column header names of any columns you want to exclude from encryption. At a minimum, you will at least want to leave the unique ID column unencrypted, so that you can pre-load encrypted data into a form.

This is demonstrated in the [encrypt_csv.py](../source/encrypt_csv.py) file. You will have to customize the contents of the template file. Customize the following parameters in the script:

* **key_path**: The file path to the encryption key that you generated (the file ending in ".pem").
* **source_path**: The file path to the CSV file with data you would like encrypted.
* **encrypted_path**: The file path to the new CSV file you would like to be created with the encrypted data. Make sure the folder path exists, you specify the new file name, and that the file name ends in `.csv`.
* **exclude_headers**: The list of columns to not be encrypted. Include column header names in the list following "exclude_headers" inside the square brackets. Be sure to specify them in quotes, separated by commas (e.g. `['column_a', 'column_b', 'column_c']`)

Once you run the script, use the file path location specified for **encrypted_path** to locate your encrypted CSV file. View the contents of the CSV file to confirm that you've encrypted all sensitive data; you may need to import the CSV file into Excel. Alternatively, [CSView](https://kothar.net/csview) is a free, cross-platform utility for opening and viewing CSV files. Do not use Google Sheets or any other cloud-based app just in case you missed some columns that should be encrypted, so your data remains safe and not saved to the cloud (for example, if you want to save your decrypted data in an Excel file, ensure that your copy of Excel doesnâ€™t automatically save files to OneDrive).

After confirming the CSV is correct, upload it to a server dataset on your SurveyCTO server for use with the [`decrypt`](https://github.com/surveycto/decrypt/blob/main/README.md) field plug-in, which will be able to decrypt the data!

## Decrypting a CSV file

It is advisable to test the decryption process. You may also need to export and view the true values at some point. To decrypt CSV data using `scto-encryption`, you can customize the [decrypt_csv.py](../source/decrypt_csv.py) template file. 

Customize the following parameters in the script:

* **key_path**: The file path to the encryption key that you generated (the file ending in ".pem").
* **encrypted_path**: The file path to the CSV file with the encrypted data you would like encrypted.
* **decrypted_path**: The file path to the new CSV file you would like to be created with the decrypted data. Make sure the folder path exists, you specify the new file name, and the file name ends in `.csv`.

Go to the location specified in **decrypted_path** to locate your decrypted CSV file. As discusssed above, view the contents of the CSV file to ensure that the decryption worked. Do not use Google Sheets or any other cloud-based app, as this can expose sensitive data.

## Using your form to decrypt pre-loaded data

Once you have prepared a server dataset with encrypted data, you can design forms to [pre-load](https://docs.surveycto.com/02-designing-forms/03-advanced-topics/03.preloading.html) that data and decrypt it using the [`decrypt`](https://github.com/surveycto/decrypt/blob/main/README.md) field plug-in for display. That data can then be updated in the form and encrypted using the same key with the [`encrypt`](https://github.com/surveycto/encrypt/blob/main/README.md) field plug-in before publishing it back to the server dataset. Server console users will not be able to view the true values stored in the server dataset unless they have the encryption key.

Have a look at [this use case]() (LINK TBC) for a full working example of managing and updating encrypted data using a form.
